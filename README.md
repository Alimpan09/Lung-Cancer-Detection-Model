# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Model
Using different Machine Learning Model, It is a trained prediction model which can predict Lung Cancer by taking various features as input with approximately 99% accuracy.
# DataSet 
he dataset used in the code includes various columns such as gender, age, smoking, yellow fingers, anxiety, peer pressure, chronic disease, fatigue, allergy, wheezing, alcohol consuming, coughing, shortness of breath, swallowing difficulty, chest pain, and lung cancer. By analyzing these variables and using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations, the predictive models can provide accurate assessments of a patient's risk of developing lung cancer.
# Models used
Logistic Regression, XGBClassifier, LGBMClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, CatBoostClassifier.
